## Key Accomplishments {#key-accomplishments}


#### Architecting a Data-Driven Sales Enablement Program {#architecting-a-data-driven-sales-enablement-program}

-   **Situation:** Lendio was losing high-value borrowers because the sales team was not equipped to sell complex traditional loans, and no system existed to identify or enable these opportunities.
-   **Task:** To design and implement a comprehensive system to enable a 15-person sales team to successfully sell traditional loan products.
-   **Action:** Designed and implemented a data-driven coaching and enablement program, including standardized process checklists, a rep performance scorecard, and leveraged Gong.io for call analysis.
-   **Result:** The system increased traditional financing conversion rates by 144%, directly driving an additional $700K in annual revenue.


#### Proactive Lead Identification and Pipeline Analysis {#proactive-lead-identification-and-pipeline-analysis}

-   **Situation:** High-potential leads for traditional loans were getting lost in the main sales pipeline.
-   **Task:** To develop a proactive process for identifying and segmenting the best opportunities for traditional loans from the main pipeline.
-   **Action:** Exported and analyzed pipeline data in DOMO and Google Sheets, segmenting opportunities by key criteria (credit score, revenue, industry) to surface the best leads.
-   **Result:** Created a proactive, data-driven lead identification process that ensured high-value borrowers were correctly routed for specialized engagement.


#### Process Automation with Slack {#process-automation-with-slack}

-   **Situation:** The process for submitting deals for cash flow analysis was manual, slow, and difficult to track.
-   **Task:** To streamline and automate the cash flow analysis submission process.
-   **Action:** Designed and implemented a Slack workflow that collected required data, logged it in a central Google Sheet, and triggered notifications to all stakeholders.
-   **Result:** Streamlined a key workflow, reducing manual effort, improving data tracking, and accelerating the analysis process.


#### ROI Modeling for Sales Enablement {#roi-modeling-for-sales-enablement}

-   **Situation:** Customers often had difficulty seeing the long-term financial benefit of equipment loans.
-   **Task:** To create a tool that would provide a compelling, quantifiable ROI for clients.
