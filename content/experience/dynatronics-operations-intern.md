## Key Accomplishments {#key-accomplishments}


#### Kanban System Design and Implementation {#kanban-system-design-and-implementation}

-   **Situation:** The company was experiencing frequent stock-outs of critical components, leading to production delays.
-   **Task:** To design and implement a new inventory replenishment process, ensuring adoption by long-tenured warehouse staff.
