## Caleb Christensen. {#caleb-christensen-dot}

I am a **Revenue Operations professional** who bridges the gap between sales strategy and technical execution.

My approach to operations is rooted in a simple philosophy: **systems should empower the individual, not hinder them.** I spent years on the front lines—from closing deals as a Commercial Loan Officer to architecting Go-to-Market divisions that scaled monthly revenue from $100k to over $350k.

I know firsthand that a "perfect" process fails if it ignores the human reality of the seller.

Unlike traditional analysts, I bring an engineer's toolkit to revenue problems.

Whether I’m automating lead distribution workflows or designing rigorous performance management frameworks in spreadsheets, I build transparent, scalable engines that drive growth.

I am currently seeking a Revenue Operations role where I can apply systems thinking to build the infrastructure of trust and efficiency.
