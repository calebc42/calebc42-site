## Go-to-Market Team Lead (Founding Sales Team) {#go-to-market-team-lead--founding-sales-team}

[2023 - 2024]

I was recruited by the Director of Operations to act as the "Founding Operator" for a new tax credit division. My mandate was to build a sales engine from scratch—hiring the team, defining the process, and implementing the technology.

Rather than just managing headcount, I focused on **engineering reliability**. I architected the end-to-end sales process and built a performance management system in Google Sheets that served as our "command center," providing real-time visibility directly from Salesforce. I also automated our lead distribution using Kixie and Salesforce to ensure equitable "speed-to-lead" routing.

Within five months, I scaled the team from 0 to 15 representatives (including the company's first successful offshore unit) and drove monthly revenue from $100k to over $350k.


## Traditional Lending Subject-Matter Expert {#traditional-lending-subject-matter-expert}

[2021 – 2023]

I was promoted into this newly created role to solve a specific leakage problem: high-value borrowers were being lost to high-interest products because the sales team wasn't equipped to sell complex traditional loans.

I acted as a one-man enablement function. I designed a data-driven coaching program that included standardized process checklists, rep performance scorecards, and targeted call analysis using Gong.io. To proactively identify opportunities, I built a segmentation workflow in DOMO and Google Sheets that surfaced high-potential leads from the general pipeline.

This operational intervention increased conversion rates on traditional products by 144%, recovering an additional $700k in annual revenue that would have otherwise been lost.


## SBA PPP Loan Forgiveness Agent {#sba-ppp-loan-forgiveness-agent}

[2021]

Entering the Fintech space during the chaotic rollout of the Paycheck Protection Program, I managed a high-volume portfolio of business owners navigating complex, shifting federal regulations.

Success in this role required rapid synthesis of changing guidelines and the ability to explain complex financial requirements to stressed business owners. I consistently ranked in the top 3 of 24 agents by submitting 70-120 compliant applications per month. This performance led to my promotion to the Subject-Matter Expert role.
